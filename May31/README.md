# Creative Project for the weekend!
### Turns out I made a cute little interactive Art piece

## Interactive Art here !!


### Logic of the piece:
Here is the youtube link to see how it works in video:

It is like palying basketball one needs to put the shape inside the shape basket.  
And in my program, mouse pressed will produce another shape from the mouse not pressed.  
When putting each in the right position, different art modes will be activated.  
So here is the main page you will see:

When putting the circle in the circle box, the art stage one will reveal.

When putting the rectangle in the rectangle box the art stage two will reveal.

### Inspiration of the art:
The example we saw in class was mainly how I got the put ball in basket idea.  
And the art modes are just me having fun with it.  
The interesting thing is I find myself really obessed with color combinations.  
I would go color website and look like there pallette for so long

### Problems:
I try to put text in as a part of the art.  
At first it wouldn't show up because I put it in setup, then after some digging online I realized it is because the draw function will cover it within a moment.  
Then I put them in draw function, but it still wouldn't show up.  
So I had to change the order of my code mutiple times for the text to show up hence the 2.5 versions.  
Eventually putting the text at the end of the functions worked.

I also had a minor confusion with the touching of mouse with the rectangle box and circle box.  
But that was easy to clear up by revisiting the class recording again.
