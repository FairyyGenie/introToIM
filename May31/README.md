## Creative Project for the weekend!
### This is most likely going to be a game 
### Turns out I made a cute little interactive Art piece

## Interactive Art here !!

Logic of the piece:

It is like palying basketball one needs to put the shape inside the shape basket.  
And in my program, mouse pressed will produce another shape from the mouse not pressed.  
When putting each in the right position, different art modes will be activated.  
So here is the main page you will see:
