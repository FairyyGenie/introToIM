Here is my first schematic drawing:

## Interesting thing that I find:
First of all, Arduino is so much fun it feels like a small gate to so many possibilities.  
Also at first I thought I am bad at circuits and everything but now I know I can actually make stuff on my own!  

The only programming issue I have face for a short minute is the setting for pushing two buttons together and pushing one button.  
My setting is that pushing two buttons only light up onw led and one would possibly light up two or more.  
So when I press two at first, everything starts lighting up at the same time.
But then I fixed that issue by seperating the two buttons and one button if functions with a bigger if function,  
````if (buttonStateBlue+buttonStateYellow+buttonStateRed==2){}````. 
This way the system will seperate the order and the lights.

The other issue is merely of convenience.  
The resistors have such long legs, it is sometimes really hard to fit them in where I would optimally want thme to be at.  
So do engineers just cut them? Maybe??
