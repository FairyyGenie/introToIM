Here is My selfportrait!

And here is the screenshot of it !!
It is kinda cute.

I find the arc function very interesting. It took me a while to realize where it is starting from and to where.

Because in normal math when we say from 0 degree to 180 degree, it should be the upper half circle. 

But here it is the downward half circle.

So everything is sort of upside down.

And it is really not east to just create a symmetric picture. 

I have had to do quite a lot of trivial math.
