## Music Instrument creation
### Concept: 

For the music Instrument, I used two sensors. One digital: a switch, and the other analog: potentiometer.  
The idea is to rotate the potentiometer and let the frequency change with it for a very simple instrument.  
And the switch serve to control the tone, if it is pressed the tone is higher then the tone not pressed.

### Interesting thing: 

Somehow at the beginning I thought I need the ```` pitches.h ```` file so I included it.  
But then I realized it is really not needed. I can just use the differences between the frequencies.
