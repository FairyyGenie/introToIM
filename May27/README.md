## Here is the assignment for the 3rd class
### Processing Art Creation

For this assignment, I find it a super fun and creative piece. 

The obstacles I have faced are getting the circles to show up randomly the way I would like it to be.

If I put the random function inside of the draw function, then the circles would just always shows up in random and unorganized order.

So when I put the random x assignment oout side of the draw function, that is when I find the pattern I want it to be.
