# Here is a project on transformation and classes!
## Interactive art !
### The part where I use pelin noise that inspiration comes from the pelin noise tutorial video by prof. Dan Shiffman.

## Flowers spinning and the circle be noising
And this is the link to the video of how it works: https://youtu.be/-LEi8injuJk

I have created the flowers as objects of the flower class, and in the class's display function I have made the condition that when mouse is pressed the flowers will start spinning.  
Same with the pelin noise circle, I drew inspiration from Professor Shiffman's tutorial and tried it our here.  
And the logic is the same, when pressing the mouse the circle will keep on noising.

I haven't tried, but is it possible to put the rotate in another function seperating from display?  
Cause when we leave the display function we would have already popMatrix(). 
So then theoretically NO?
