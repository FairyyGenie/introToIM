## OOP assignment!
### this is a flying star piece

In this assignment, I used relatively simple class of star to create the star objects.  
And the overall concept is to imagine stars flying in the sky.  
There are not much problem that I encountered making this piece.  
Just that the star function I found in the processing example is so fascinating.  
There are so many shapes already created and seemingly very complicated.
