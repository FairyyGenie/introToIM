## Logic of the game

The first stage(Introduction):  
You will see a page explaining the game for you. And by pressing the ````Let's Go```` button you will enter the real game.  
When entering this page the background music will start looping.

The second stage(Gaming):  
So you will see four differnt recycle bins on the bottom of the frame and the trashes will fall from the sky.  
And the challenge is to know which trash goes into which trash bin.  
When it is being put in the right one, the windmill will start spinning and produce electricity. And there will be a sound effect saying "nice!"
When it is into the wrong ones, the windmill will stop and no electricity produced. The sound effect here is "Oh No!"
There will be 30 trashes for you to sort. When all 30 finshed dropping from the sky, you will enter the next stage(Results).

The third stage(Results):  
The results are in three levels "beginner", "Intermediate", and "Master."  
In this page you will get to see your score, how much electricity was produced, and choose to restart the game or just exit.  
If choose to restart then the game jump back to the second stage.


## Problems I found 
### 1. The speed update

### 2. Class interaction

### 3. When to initiate class objects

### 4. WindMill Rotation

### 5. Restart of the game

### 6. Time management
