### Idea
My Idea right now is to make a environmental energy saving game.  
There will be windmill spinning if you pick the right answer to the questions.  
And whoever gets the windmill to produce enough energy will win the game!!  
So now the problem is wat kind of format I would like to carry out, maybe quiz people on the right recycle items?  
A animated basket will catch the trash and who ever answer the most correct answers gets the windmill to spin more.  
Maybe I will use keys to determine the answers.
