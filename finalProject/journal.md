## For the final Project !!!
### Idea:
I kind of want to build a music game of some sort, but at the same time I am kind of scared this is not creative enough so maybe I will think about this more.  
### Proposal:

Maybe asked a song's chords?  Or maybe just have give the user choices to make a song ?  
So the processing side will in some form ask you a music question. And according to the answer of your choice, use the arduino to answer.  
A music game using switch, Tone, and light sensor or potentiometer. Maybe use also LCD to show if you answered the right choice.

### Refined proposal:  

Suggestions from professor: have a way to hear the notes before selecting them maybe with a switch.
Move the hand from left to right with potentiometer and light sensor to go up and down, and a switch to catch it.  
Catch the notes after hearing the melody once, and maybe give some hints. 

### plan for each day:
#### July 1st: 

Try importing and finding some melody into processing first, and create sprites.

#### July 2nd:

Build the music question class.
And set up the arduino sprite movement: light sensor and potentiometer.

#### July 3rd:

Figure out a way to let the arduino play the tone if choosed a note.

#### July 4th:

Game logic, and try adding hints and other stuff.

#### July 5th:  

Can I make this game more fun and interactive?
